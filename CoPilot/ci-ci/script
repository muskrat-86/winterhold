To run a script on a GitLab runner using a pipeline, you'll need to set up a .gitlab-ci.yml file in your repository. Here's a basic example to get you started:

Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file at the root of your repository.
Define your jobs and stages in this file.
Here's a simple example:

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."
    - ./build_script.sh

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - ./test_script.sh

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - ./deploy_script.sh
Steps to Set Up a Runner
Install GitLab Runner on your machine. You can follow the official installation guide for detailed steps.

Register the Runner with your GitLab instance:

Run the registration command: gitlab-runner register
Enter the GitLab instance URL and the registration token from your project.
Choose an executor (e.g., shell, Docker).
Provide a description and tags for the runner.
Verify the Runner is active in your project's CI/CD settings.

Running the Pipeline
Once your .gitlab-ci.yml file is committed to the repository, GitLab will automatically trigger the pipeline, and the runner will execute the defined jobs.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the GitLab CI/CD documentation1.
