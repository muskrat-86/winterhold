automated VM Installation with SaltStack
Copilot said:
Copilot
Automating VM installation with SaltStack is a powerful way to manage and configure your virtual machines. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Setting Up SaltStack
Prerequisites:

A Salt Master server.
Salt Minions installed on the VMs you want to manage.
Steps:

Install Salt Master:
sudo dnf install -y salt-master
sudo systemctl enable --now salt-master
Install Salt Minion on VMs:
sudo dnf install -y salt-minion
sudo systemctl enable --now salt-minion
Configure the Minion to connect to the Master by editing /etc/salt/minion:
master: <Salt_Master_IP>
Restart the Minion service:
sudo systemctl restart salt-minion
2. Creating a Salt State for VM Configuration
Example State File (/srv/salt/vm_setup.sls):

install_packages:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - httpd
      - mariadb-server
      - php

start_services:
  service.running:
    - name: httpd
    - enable: True
  service.running:
    - name: mariadb
    - enable: True
3. Applying the State to VMs
Steps:

Accept Minion Keys on the Master:
sudo salt-key -A
Apply the State:
sudo salt '*' state.apply vm_setup
4. Integrating with vSphere
Using SaltStack with vSphere:

Install Salt Cloud:

sudo dnf install -y salt-cloud
Configure Salt Cloud for vSphere: Edit /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/vsphere.conf:

my-vsphere-config:
  driver: vsphere
  user: '<vSphere_Username>'
  password: '<vSphere_Password>'
  url: 'vcenter.example.com'
  protocol: 'https'
  port: 443
Edit /etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/vsphere.conf:

my-vm-profile:
  provider: my-vsphere-config
  clonefrom: 'template-vm'
  num_cpus: 2
  memory: 2048
  devices:
    disk:
      Hard disk 1:
        size: 20
    network:
      Network adapter 1:
        name: 'VM Network'
        switch_type: standard
Create a VM:

sudo salt-cloud -p my-vm-profile new-vm

Copilot said:
Copilot
Integrating the automation tasks with GitLab Pipelines is a great way to streamline and manage your workflow. Hereâ€™s how you can set up a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate the creation of a custom Rocky Linux ISO, deployment to a vSphere cluster, and configuration using SaltStack.

1. GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in your repository with the following content:

stages:
  - build
  - deploy
  - configure

variables:
  ISO_PATH: "/path/to/rocky-linux.iso"
  OUTPUT_ISO: "/path/to/custom-rocky-linux.iso"
  KICKSTART_FILE: "/path/to/kickstart.cfg"
  PACKER_TEMPLATE: "/path/to/packer-template.json"
  MINION_CONFIG: "/etc/salt/minion"
  MASTER_IP: "192.168.1.100"
  STATE_FILE: "vm_setup"

build_iso:
  stage: build
  image: rocky:9
  script:
    - dnf install -y lorax
    - mkksiso --ks $KICKSTART_FILE $ISO_PATH $OUTPUT_ISO
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - $OUTPUT_ISO

deploy_vsphere:
  stage: deploy
  image: hashicorp/packer:latest
  script:
    - packer build $PACKER_TEMPLATE

configure_salt:
  stage: configure
  image: rocky:9
  script:
    - dnf install -y salt-master salt-minion
    - echo "master: $MASTER_IP" > $MINION_CONFIG
    - systemctl restart salt-minion
    - salt '*' state.apply $STATE_FILE
2. Explanation
Stages: The pipeline is divided into three stages: build, deploy, and configure.
Variables: Define variables for paths and configurations to make the script more flexible.
build_iso: This job installs Lorax and creates a custom Rocky Linux ISO using the specified Kickstart file. The resulting ISO is stored as an artifact.
deploy_vsphere: This job uses the Packer Docker image to deploy the custom ISO to a vSphere cluster.
configure_salt: This job installs Salt Master and Minion, configures the Minion to connect to the Master, and applies the Salt state to all Minions.
3. Setting Up GitLab Runner
Ensure you have a GitLab Runner configured to execute the pipeline. You can follow the GitLab Runner installation guide for detailed instructions.

4. Running the Pipeline
Push your changes to the GitLab repository:
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add GitLab CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
Monitor the pipeline: Go to your GitLab project, navigate to CI/CD > Pipelines, and monitor the progress of your pipeline.
This setup will automate the entire process using GitLab CI/CD. If you have any questions or need further customization, feel free to ask!

create python configuration files for this project so we can create different VMs with different useages
Copilot said:
Copilot
I've created a Python script that generates configuration files for different VM usages. The configurations are saved in a JSON file. Here's the script and the resulting configuration file:

Python Script
import json

# Configuration for different VM usages
vm_configurations = {
    "web_server": {
        "name": "web-server",
        "num_cpus": 2,
        "memory": 2048,
        "disk_size": 40960,
        "packages": ["httpd", "php"],
        "services": ["httpd"]
    },
    "database_server": {
        "name": "database-server",
        "num_cpus": 4,
        "memory": 4096,
        "disk_size": 81920,
        "packages": ["mariadb-server"],
        "services": ["mariadb"]
    },
    "application_server": {
        "name": "application-server",
        "num_cpus": 4,
        "memory": 8192,
        "disk_size": 102400,
        "packages": ["nginx", "nodejs"],
        "services": ["nginx"]
    }
}

# Save the configurations to a JSON file
with open('vm_configurations.json', 'w') as config_file:
    json.dump(vm_configurations, config_file, indent=4)

print("VM configurations saved to vm_configurations.json")
Configuration File
You can download the generated configuration file here.

Usage
You can use this JSON file to create different VMs with specific configurations. Here's an example of how you might use it in your automation script:

import json
import subprocess

def create_vm(config):
    # Example function to create a VM using the configuration
    print(f"Creating VM: {config['name']}")
    # Add your VM creation logic here

def main():
    with open('vm_configurations.json', 'r') as config_file:
        vm_configs = json.load(config_file)
    
    for vm_type, config in vm_configs.items():
        create_vm(config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This script reads the configurations from the JSON file and creates VMs based on the specified settings. You can expand the create_vm function to include the actual logic for creating and configuring the VMs.

For our custom-rocky-linux.iso, include UEFI boot menu options for kickstart zero-touch install and PXE boot/install 
Copilot said:
Copilot
To include UEFI boot menu options for a Kickstart zero-touch install and PXE boot/install in your custom Rocky Linux ISO, you'll need to modify the bootloader configuration and include the necessary boot options. Here's how you can do it:

1. Modify the Bootloader Configuration
Steps:

Mount the ISO:
mkdir /mnt/iso
mount -o loop /path/to/rocky-linux.iso /mnt/iso
Copy the ISO contents to a working directory:
mkdir /tmp/iso
cp -r /mnt/iso/* /tmp/iso
umount /mnt/iso
Modify the bootloader configuration: Edit the grub.cfg file located in /tmp/iso/EFI/BOOT/ to include the UEFI boot menu options.
Example grub.cfg:
set default=0
set timeout=5

menuentry 'Install Rocky Linux 9' {
    linuxefi /images/pxeboot/vmlinuz inst.stage2=hd:LABEL=Rocky-9-0-x86_64-dvd quiet
    initrdefi /images/pxeboot/initrd.img
}

menuentry 'Kickstart Zero-Touch Install' {
    linuxefi /images/pxeboot/vmlinuz inst.stage2=hd:LABEL=Rocky-9-0-x86_64-dvd inst.ks=hd:LABEL=Rocky-9-0-x86_64-dvd:/ks.cfg quiet
    initrdefi /images/pxeboot/initrd.img
}

menuentry 'PXE Boot/Install' {
    linuxefi /images/pxeboot/vmlinuz inst.stage2=hd:LABEL=Rocky-9-0-x86_64-dvd inst.repo=http://<PXE_SERVER>/repo quiet
    initrdefi /images/pxeboot/initrd.img
}
2. Create the Custom ISO
Steps:

Generate the new ISO:
mkisofs -o /path/to/custom-rocky-linux.iso -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -eltorito-alt-boot -e images/efiboot.img -no-emul-boot -R -J -v -T /tmp/iso
Explanation
Menu Entries: The grub.cfg file includes three menu entries:

Install Rocky Linux 9: Standard installation.
Kickstart Zero-Touch Install: Uses a Kickstart file for automated installation.
PXE Boot/Install: Boots from a PXE server for network installation.
Boot Options: The linuxefi and initrdefi commands specify the kernel and initrd images, along with the necessary boot options for each menu entry.

Usage
Update the grub.cfg file with your specific configurations, such as the PXE server URL and Kickstart file location.
Create the custom ISO using the modified grub.cfg file.
This setup should provide UEFI boot menu options for a Kickstart zero-touch install and PXE boot/install. If you have any questions or need further customization, feel free to ask!
