Photon OS is a minimal Linux container host optimized for VMware environments. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for running containers and virtual machines.

Keepalived is a high-availability and load-balancing solution that works well with Photon OS. It provides robust keepalive functionality for Linux Virtual Server (LVS) and implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) to handle failover scenarios1.

To set up Keepalived on Photon OS, you can follow these general steps:

Install Keepalived:

tdnf install keepalived -y
Configure Keepalived:

Edit the configuration file located at /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf.
Define the VRRP instances and scripts to monitor your services.
Enable and Start Keepalived:

systemctl enable keepalived
systemctl start keepalived
For a detailed guide on setting up Keepalived with Photon OS, including load balancing with HAProxy, you can refer to resources like the VMware Horizon/AppVolumes LB with HAProxy and Keepalived on PhotonOS blog2.

How to configure VRRP in Keepalived?

Configuring VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) in Keepalived involves setting up a virtual IP address that can be managed by multiple nodes to ensure high availability. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

Install Keepalived:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install keepalived
Backup the Default Configuration:

sudo mv /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf.original
Create a New Configuration File:

sudo nano /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
Configure VRRP: Add the following configuration to the keepalived.conf file:

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass your_password
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
}
state: Defines the initial state of the instance (MASTER or BACKUP).
interface: The network interface to run VRRP on.
virtual_router_id: A unique identifier for the VRRP instance.
priority: The priority of the node (higher value means higher priority).
advert_int: Advertisement interval in seconds.
authentication: Authentication type and password.
virtual_ipaddress: The virtual IP address to be managed.
Start and Enable Keepalived:

sudo systemctl start keepalived
sudo systemctl enable keepalived
Verify the Configuration: Check the status of Keepalived to ensure it's running correctly:

sudo systemctl status keepalived
This basic configuration sets up a VRRP instance with a virtual IP address that will be managed by Keepalived. If the MASTER node fails, a BACKUP node with a lower priority will take over the virtual IP address, ensuring high availability12.
