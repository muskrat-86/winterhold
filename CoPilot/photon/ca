photon os, ca-trust package
Copilot said:
Copilot
To manage CA certificates in Photon OS, you can use the ca-certificates package. This package includes a bundle of CA certificates that are used to verify SSL connections. Here are some steps to add a trusted root certificate to Photon OS:

Install the ca-certificates package:

tdnf install ca-certificates
Add your root certificate:

Copy your root certificate to the /etc/ssl/certs directory.
Run the c_rehash command to update the certificate hashes:
c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs
Verify the installation:

Ensure your certificate is correctly added by checking the directory:
ls -l /etc/ssl/certs
If you encounter issues with the c_rehash command, you might need to install the openssl-c_rehash package12.

To activate the c_rehash command in Photon OS, you need to install the openssl-c_rehash package. Here are the steps:

Install the openssl-c_rehash package:

tdnf install openssl-c_rehash
Run the c_rehash command:

c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs
This will create symbolic links in the /etc/ssl/certs directory, which are used by OpenSSL to verify certificates.

If you encounter any issues, such as the c_rehash command not being found, ensure that the openssl-c_rehash package is correctly installed12.

Photon OS uses the tdnf package manager to handle dependencies for OpenSSL. Here are some key dependencies and packages related to OpenSSL in Photon OS:

OpenSSL Libraries:

openssl-libs: Core libraries needed by OpenSSL.
openssl-devel: Development libraries for OpenSSL.
openssl-perl: Perl scripts for OpenSSL.
openssl-c_rehash: Scripts for rehashing CA certificates.
Installation: To install OpenSSL and its dependencies, you can use the following commands:

tdnf install openssl
tdnf install openssl-libs
tdnf install openssl-devel
tdnf install openssl-perl
tdnf install openssl-c_rehash
Checking Installed Packages: To verify the installed OpenSSL packages, you can use:

tdnf list installed | grep openssl
Manual Installation: If you need to manually install a package, you can download the RPM files from the Photon OS repository and install them using rpm:

rpm -i package-name.rpm
For more detailed information, you can refer to the Photon OS documentation or the OpenSSL spec file on GitHub12.

c_rehash not working on photon os
Copilot said:
Copilot
If the c_rehash command is not working on Photon OS, it might be due to a few common issues. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

Ensure openssl-c_rehash is installed: Make sure the openssl-c_rehash package is installed. You can install it using:

tdnf install openssl-c_rehash
Check for missing dependencies: Sometimes, missing dependencies can cause issues. Verify that all required dependencies are installed:

tdnf install perl
tdnf install perl-DBIx-Simple
Update CA certificates: If you have added new CA certificates, ensure they are correctly hashed:

c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs
Manual rehashing: If c_rehash is still not working, you can manually create the symbolic links:

ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/$(openssl x509 -hash -noout -in /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.pem).0
Check for SSL proxy issues: If you are behind an SSL proxy, it might interfere with the installation. You can modify the repository URLs from https to http in /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo files as a workaround12.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, you might need to manually download and install the openssl-c_rehash package and its dependencies from the Photon OS repository2.

photon os, update-ca-trust
Copilot said:
Copilot
To update the CA trust store in Photon OS, you can use the update-ca-trust command. This command manages the consolidated and dynamic configuration of CA certificates. Here are the steps to update the CA trust store:

Install the ca-certificates package (if not already installed):

tdnf install ca-certificates
Add your custom CA certificate:

Copy your CA certificate to the /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ directory:
cp your-cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
Update the CA trust store:

Run the update-ca-trust command to update the trust store:
update-ca-trust
Verify the update:

Ensure your certificate is included in the trust store:
ls -l /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt
These steps will ensure that your custom CA certificates are recognized by the system and used for SSL/TLS connections12.

photon os, update-ca-trust command not availabl
Copilot said:
Copilot
If the update-ca-trust command is not available on Photon OS, it might be due to the absence of the required package or an alternative method for managing CA certificates. Here are some steps you can follow to manage CA certificates without update-ca-trust:

Install the ca-certificates package: Ensure that the ca-certificates package is installed, as it provides the necessary tools and certificates.

tdnf install ca-certificates
Add your custom CA certificate:

Copy your CA certificate to the /etc/ssl/certs directory:
cp your-cert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/
Rehash the certificates:

Use the c_rehash command to update the certificate hashes:
c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs
Manual Update: If c_rehash is not working, you can manually create the symbolic links:

ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/$(openssl x509 -hash -noout -in /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.pem).0
These steps should help you manage CA certificates on Photon OS even if the update-ca-trust command is not available12.
