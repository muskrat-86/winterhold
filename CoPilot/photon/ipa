To join Photon OS to an IPA (Identity, Policy, Audit) domain, you'll need to follow a few steps. Here's a general outline:

Install Required Packages: Ensure you have the necessary packages installed. You might need to install freeipa-client and other dependencies.

tdnf install freeipa-client
Configure Network: Make sure your Photon OS has a proper network configuration. You can set a static IP if needed. Configuration files are typically located in /etc/systemd/network/.

Join the IPA Domain: Use the ipa-client-install command to join the domain. You'll need the IPA server's address and admin credentials.

ipa-client-install --domain=yourdomain.com --server=ipa.yourdomain.com --realm=YOURDOMAIN.COM
Verify the Configuration: After joining, verify that the configuration is correct and that the system is properly integrated into the IPA domain.

ipa user-find
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the Photon OS documentation1.
