photon os, salt-master
Copilot said:
Copilot
Photon OS is a lightweight Linux distribution developed by VMware, optimized for running on VMware platforms. It is designed to be minimal, secure, and efficient, making it a good choice for containerized applications and cloud-native environments.

Salt, also known as SaltStack, is an open-source configuration management and orchestration tool. It uses a master-client model where the Salt master issues commands to Salt minions, which execute those commands.

Photon OS supports running both the Salt master and Salt minion services1. Here’s a brief overview of how you can set up a Salt master on Photon OS:

Install Salt Master:

First, ensure you have Python and necessary dependencies installed:
tdnf install python git pycrypto python-zmq
Install pip:
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
Clone the Salt repository and install it:
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/saltstack/salt
cd salt
python setup.py install
Configure Salt Master:

Create a systemd service unit for the Salt master:
cat > /etc/systemd/system/salt-master.service <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=The Salt Master
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
NotifyAccess=all
LimitNOFILE=8192
ExecStart=/bin/salt-master

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
Start and Enable the Service:

Enable and start the Salt master service:
systemctl enable salt-master
systemctl start salt-master
This setup will allow you to manage your infrastructure using Salt on Photon OS23.

photon os, kickstart
Copilot said:
Copilot
Photon OS supports Kickstart for unattended and automated installations. Kickstart allows you to automate the installation process by providing a configuration file that specifies the settings and packages to be installed.

Here’s a brief overview of how to use Kickstart with Photon OS:

Create a Kickstart Configuration File:

The Kickstart file is typically in JSON format and includes various settings like hostname, password, disk partitions, and packages to install. Here’s a simple example:
{
  "hostname": "photon-machine",
  "password": {
    "crypted": false,
    "text": "changeme"
  },
  "disk": "/dev/sda",
  "partitions": [
    {
      "mountpoint": "/",
      "size": 0,
      "filesystem": "ext4"
    },
    {
      "mountpoint": "/boot",
      "size": 128,
      "filesystem": "ext4"
    },
    {
      "size": 128,
      "filesystem": "swap"
    }
  ],
  "bootmode": "bios",
  "packagelist_file": "packages_minimal.json",
  "additional_packages": ["vim"],
  "postinstall": [
    "#!/bin/sh",
    "echo \"Hello World\" > /etc/postinstall"
  ],
  "public_key": "<ssh-key-here>",
  "network": {
    "type": "dhcp"
  }
}
Provide the Kickstart File:

You can provide the Kickstart file in several ways:
HTTP Server: Serve the file from an HTTP server and specify the URL during boot.
ks=http://<server>/<path-to-kickstart-file>
CD-ROM: Include the Kickstart file in the ISO and specify the path.
ks=cdrom:/isolinux/ks.cfg
Secondary Device: Use a secondary device like a USB drive.
ks=/dev/sr1:/isolinux/ks.cfg
Boot with the Kickstart File:

When booting Photon OS, pass the ks parameter to the kernel to specify the location of the Kickstart file. For example:
linux ks=http://<server>/<path-to-kickstart-file>
Using Kickstart with Photon OS can significantly streamline the deployment process, especially in large-scale environments12.

ssh , user cert
Copilot said:
Copilot
Using SSH user certificates can enhance security and simplify key management. Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up SSH user certificates:

Create a Certificate Authority (CA):

Generate a key pair for the CA:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/ssh_user_ca
Sign User Keys with the CA:

Generate a key pair for the user:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/user-key
Sign the user’s public key with the CA:
ssh-keygen -s ~/.ssh/ssh_user_ca -I user-cert -n username -V +52w ~/.ssh/user-key.pub
Configure the SSH Server to Trust the CA:

Copy the CA’s public key to the SSH server:
scp ~/.ssh/ssh_user_ca.pub user@server:/etc/ssh/
Edit the SSH server configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) to trust the CA:
TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ssh_user_ca.pub
Restart the SSH service:
systemctl restart sshd
Configure the SSH Client:

On the client machine, specify the certificate in the SSH configuration (~/.ssh/config):
Host server
  HostName server
  User username
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/user-key
  CertificateFile ~/.ssh/user-key-cert.pub
Verify the Setup:

Connect to the server using SSH:
ssh server
This setup allows the SSH server to authenticate users based on certificates signed by the CA, enhancing security and simplifying key management123.

ssh command specifying key
Copilot said:
Copilot
To specify a private key when using the ssh command, you can use the -i option followed by the path to your private key file. Here’s the syntax:

ssh -i /path/to/private_key user@hostname
For example, if your private key is located at ~/.ssh/id_rsa and you want to connect to a server with the username user at example.com, you would use:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@example.com
This command tells SSH to use the specified private key for authentication12.

If you frequently connect to multiple servers with different keys, you can simplify this process by configuring your SSH client to use specific keys for specific hosts. You can do this by editing your ~/.ssh/config file:

Host example
    HostName example.com
    User user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host another-example
    HostName another-example.com
    User anotheruser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/another_id_rsa
With this configuration, you can simply use:

ssh example
or

ssh another-example
And SSH will automatically use the correct key for each host34.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

can photon os use epel
Copilot said:
Copilot
Photon OS does not directly support the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository, as it uses its own package manager called Tiny Dandified YUM (tdnf) and has its own repositories for software packages12. However, you can often find or build equivalent packages for Photon OS from its repositories or by compiling from source.

If you need a specific package that is available in EPEL but not in Photon OS repositories, you might consider the following approaches:

Check Photon OS Repositories:

Photon OS has several repositories like photon, photon-updates, and photon-extras. Ensure these are enabled and up-to-date:
tdnf repolist
tdnf makecache
Build from Source:

If the package is not available, you can download the source code and compile it on Photon OS. This might require installing development tools and dependencies:
tdnf install -y make gcc
Use Docker Containers:

If building from source is not feasible, consider using Docker containers. Photon OS supports Docker, and you can run a container with a different base image that includes the required packages.
Custom Repositories:

You can create and use custom repositories if you have specific packages that need to be managed centrally.
While Photon OS aims to be minimal and optimized for VMware environments, these methods can help you extend its capabilities to meet your needs123.

If you have any specific packages in mind or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
