Creating a custom Photon OS image involves several steps. Here's a general guide to help you get started:

Install Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed. On Photon OS, you can use the following command:
tdnf install -y python3-pip git tar createrepo_c binutils dosfstools cdrkit
Install the Photon OS installer Python library:
pip3 install git+https://github.com/vmware/photon-os-installer.git
Prepare for Custom Image Generation:

Enable Docker service:
systemctl start docker.service
docker login
Create a Custom Package List:

Create a JSON file listing the packages you want to include. For example:
{
  "packages": ["package1", "package2"],
  "packages_x86_64": ["package3"],
  "packages_aarch64": ["package4"]
}
Generate the Custom ISO:

Clone the Photon OS installer repository:
git clone https://github.com/vmware/photon-os-installer.git
cd photon-os-installer/photon_installer
Run the ISO builder with your custom package list:
./isoBuilder -v 5.0 -p /path/to/your/packages_minimal.json
This process will create a custom Photon OS ISO based on the packages and configurations you specified1.

haproxy high availability setup
Copilot said:

Setting up HAProxy for high availability typically involves using a tool like Keepalived to manage failover between multiple HAProxy instances. Here's a general guide to get you started:

Prerequisites
Two or more servers for HAProxy.
Keepalived installed on each server.
Basic knowledge of HAProxy and Linux system administration.
Step-by-Step Guide
Install HAProxy and Keepalived:

On each server, install HAProxy and Keepalived. For example, on Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install haproxy keepalived
Configure HAProxy:

Edit the HAProxy configuration file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg) to define your frontend and backend settings. Here's a basic example:
frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    default_backend http_back

backend http_back
    balance roundrobin
    server web1 192.168.1.2:80 check
    server web2 192.168.1.3:80 check
Configure Keepalived:

Edit the Keepalived configuration file (/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf) to set up VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol). Here's an example configuration:
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 101
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass 1234
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
}
On the second server, change state to BACKUP and priority to a lower value (e.g., 100).
Start and Enable Services:

Start and enable HAProxy and Keepalived on both servers:
sudo systemctl start haproxy
sudo systemctl enable haproxy
sudo systemctl start keepalived
sudo systemctl enable keepalived
Test the Setup:

Ensure that the virtual IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100) is accessible and that traffic is properly load-balanced between your backend servers. Test failover by stopping Keepalived on the master server and verifying that the backup server takes over the virtual IP.
This setup ensures that if the primary HAProxy server fails, Keepalived will automatically switch the virtual IP to the backup server, maintaining high availability123.

photon os, enable ssh

To enable SSH on Photon OS, follow these steps:

Edit the SSH Configuration File:

Open the SSH configuration file using a text editor like vi:
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Permit Root Login:

Find the line that reads #PermitRootLogin prohibit-password and uncomment it by removing the # at the beginning. Then change prohibit-password to yes:
PermitRootLogin yes
Restart the SSH Service:

Save the changes and restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration:
systemctl restart sshd
Open SSH Port in Firewall (if applicable):

Ensure that the SSH port (default is 22) is open in your firewall settings. For example, using iptables:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
Connect via SSH:

You should now be able to connect to your Photon OS instance using an SSH client like PuTTY or the ssh command:
ssh root@<your_photon_os_ip>
These steps will enable SSH access on your Photon OS system123. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
