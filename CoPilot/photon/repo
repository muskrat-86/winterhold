To configure a remote repository in Photon OS, you'll need to create a repository configuration file. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Create a Repository Configuration File:

Navigate to the /etc/yum.repos.d directory.
Create a new file with a .repo extension. For example, myrepo.repo.
Edit the Configuration File:

Open the file in a text editor and add the repository details. Here's an example configuration:
[myrepo]
name=My Custom Repository
baseurl=http://your-repo-url/path/to/repo
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://your-repo-url/path/to/gpgkey
Replace http://your-repo-url/path/to/repo with the actual URL of your repository.
If your repository requires authentication, you can add username and password settings.
Save and Exit:

Save the changes and exit the text editor.
Update the Repository Cache:

Run the following command to update the repository metadata:
sudo tdnf makecache
This will configure your Photon OS to use the specified remote repository for package management12.

httpd default dir
Copilot said:
Copilot
The default directory for the Apache HTTP server, also known as the DocumentRoot, is typically set to /var/www/html1. This is the directory where Apache looks for files to serve to clients.

If you need to change this default directory, you can do so by editing the Apache configuration file. Here’s how:

Open the Configuration File:

For most Linux distributions, the configuration file is located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora) or /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf (Ubuntu/Debian).
Edit the DocumentRoot Directive:

Find the line that starts with DocumentRoot and change it to your desired directory. For example:
DocumentRoot "/path/to/your/new/directory"
Update Directory Settings:

You also need to update the <Directory> section to match the new DocumentRoot. For example:
<Directory "/path/to/your/new/directory">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
</Directory>
Restart Apache:

After making these changes, restart the Apache service to apply them:
sudo systemctl restart httpd  # For CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo systemctl restart apache2  # For Ubuntu/Debian
This will change the directory from which Apache serves files to the new location you specified12.

httpd, where is "it works"
Copilot said:
Copilot
The "It works!" page is the default web page served by Apache HTTP Server (httpd) when it is successfully installed and running. This page is typically located in the default DocumentRoot directory, which is usually /var/www/html1.

The actual file that contains the "It works!" message is usually named index.html and can be found in the /var/www/html directory. You can modify or replace this file with your own content to customize the default page served by your Apache server.

If you need to locate or change this file, you can navigate to the directory and edit the index.html file:

cd /var/www/html
sudo nano index.html

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key

    <Directory "/var/www/html">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
