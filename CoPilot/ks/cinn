To set up Rocky Linux with Kickstart and advanced options, you can use the liveinst syntax in your Kickstart configuration file. Here are some key points and examples to help you get started:

Basic Kickstart Syntax
A Kickstart file is a simple text file containing configuration options for an automated installation. Here’s a basic example:

# System language
lang en_US.UTF-8

# Keyboard layout
keyboard us

# Network configuration
network --bootproto=dhcp --device=eth0

# Root password
rootpw --iscrypted $6$xyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyz

# Timezone
timezone America/New_York --utc

# Bootloader configuration
bootloader --location=mbr

# Partitioning
clearpart --all --initlabel
part / --fstype="xfs" --size=10240
part swap --size=2048

# Package selection
%packages
@core
%end
Advanced Options
For more advanced configurations, you can include additional options such as custom scripts, network configurations, and user setups.

Custom Scripts
You can add custom scripts to run at different stages of the installation:

%pre
# Pre-installation script
echo "Running pre-installation script"
%end

%post
# Post-installation script
echo "Running post-installation script"
%end
Network Configuration
You can configure multiple network interfaces and set up SSH keys:

network --bootproto=dhcp --device=eth0 --onboot=yes --hostname=rocky.local
network --bootproto=dhcp --device=eth1 --onboot=yes

# SSH key setup
%post
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAr..." > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
%end
User and Group Setup
You can create users and groups, and set password policies:

group --name=admin --gid=1000
user --name=admin --groups=admin --password=plaintextpassword

# Password policies
pwpolicy root --minlen=6 --minquality=1 --notstrict --nochanges --notempty
pwpolicy user --minlen=6 --minquality=1 --notstrict --nochanges --emptyok
For more detailed examples and configurations, you can refer to the Rocky Linux Kickstart repository on GitHub1 or other comprehensive guides2.

How to customize package selection?
Copilot said:
Copilot
To customize package selection in your Kickstart file, you use the %packages section. This section allows you to specify which packages and package groups should be installed during the automated installation. Here’s how you can do it:

Basic Package Selection
Start the package selection section with %packages and end it with %end. You can list individual packages or package groups.

%packages
@core
@^minimal-environment
vim
wget
%end
In this example:

@core installs the core package group.
@^minimal-environment installs the minimal environment.
vim and wget are individual packages.
Excluding Packages
You can exclude specific packages using the - prefix.

%packages
@core
@^minimal-environment
-vim
-wget
%end
Including Repositories
You can also specify additional repositories to pull packages from:

repo --name="Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux" --baseurl=http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/
Advanced Package Selection
For more advanced configurations, you can use module streams and profiles:

%packages
@core
@^minimal-environment
@container-tools:2.0
%end
In this example, @container-tools:2.0 installs the container tools module stream version 2.0.

Example with Custom Repositories and Exclusions
Here’s a more comprehensive example:

repo --name="EPEL" --baseurl=https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/
repo --name="CustomRepo" --baseurl=http://my.custom.repo/path

%packages
@core
@^minimal-environment
@development
vim
wget
-gcc
%end
This example includes:

Adding custom repositories.
Installing core, minimal environment, and development groups.
Installing vim and wget.
Excluding gcc.
For more detailed information, you can refer to the Red Hat Kickstart documentation1.

liveinst syntax samples
Copilot said:
Copilot
Here are some examples of using the liveinst syntax for installing Rocky Linux from a live environment:

Basic liveinst Command
The liveinst command is used to start the installation process from a live environment. Here’s a simple example:

sudo liveinst
This command will launch the graphical installer.

Using liveinst with Anaconda Arguments
You can pass arguments to the Anaconda installer using the --anaconda-args option. For example, to start the installation in text mode:

sudo liveinst --anaconda-args="--text"
Advanced Example with VNC
To perform a remote installation using VNC, you can use the following command:

sudo liveinst --anaconda-args="--vnc --vncpassword=yourpassword"
This will start the installer and allow you to connect via VNC using the specified password.

Customizing the Installation
You can also customize the installation process by specifying additional options. For example, to set the root password and configure the network:

sudo liveinst --anaconda-args="--rootpw=yourpassword --network=eth0:dhcp"
Example with Kickstart File
If you have a Kickstart file, you can use it to automate the installation:

sudo liveinst --kickstart=/path/to/your-ks.cfg
Example with Custom Repositories
To include custom repositories during the installation, you can specify them in the Kickstart file or pass them as arguments:

sudo liveinst --anaconda-args="--repo=http://my.custom.repo/path"
These examples should help you get started with using liveinst for various installation scenarios. For more detailed information, you can refer to the NST liveinst documentation1 and the Anaconda GitHub repository2.
