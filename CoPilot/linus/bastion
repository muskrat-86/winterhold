powershell script to create an SSH tunnel from local-machine to remote-machine through bastion-server
Copilot said:
Copilot
Sure, I can help with that! Below is a PowerShell script that creates an SSH tunnel from your local machine to a remote machine through a bastion server. This script uses ssh command-line utility, so make sure you have OpenSSH installed on your local machine.
# Define variables
$bastionServer = "bastion.example.com"
$bastionUser = "bastionUser"
$remoteServer = "remote.example.com"
$remoteUser = "remoteUser"
$localPort = 2222
$remotePort = 22
# Create SSH tunnel
ssh -L $localPort:$remoteServer:$remotePort $bastionUser@$bastionServer -N -f
# Connect to the remote server through the tunnel
ssh -p $localPort $remoteUser@localhost
Explanation:
1. Variables: Define the bastion server, remote server, and user details.
2. SSH Tunnel: The ssh -L command creates a local port forwarding tunnel. It forwards connections from $localPort on your local machine to $remotePort on the remote server through the bastion server.
3. Connect: The second ssh command connects to the remote server through the established tunnel.
Make sure to replace the placeholder values (e.g., bastion.example.com, bastionUser, remote.example.com, remoteUser) with your actual server and user details.
Would you like any additional features or modifications to this script?

use this tunnel to set up passwordless ssh key login from local-machine to remote-machine
Copilot said:
Copilot
To set up passwordless SSH key login from your local machine to the remote machine through the bastion server, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair and copy the public key to the remote machine. Here's how you can do it:
Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair
If you don't already have an SSH key pair, you can generate one using the following command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This will create a public key (id_rsa.pub) and a private key (id_rsa) in the ~/.ssh directory.
Step 2: Copy Public Key to Remote Machine
Use the SSH tunnel to copy your public key to the remote machine. Here's a script that combines the tunnel creation and key copying:
# Define variables
$bastionServer = "bastion.example.com"
$bastionUser = "bastionUser"
$remoteServer = "remote.example.com"
$remoteUser = "remoteUser"
$localPort = 2222
$remotePort = 22
# Create SSH tunnel
ssh -L $localPort:$remoteServer:$remotePort $bastionUser@$bastionServer -N -f
# Copy public key to remote machine
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p $localPort $remoteUser@localhost
Step 3: Verify Passwordless Login
After copying the public key, you can verify the passwordless login by connecting to the remote machine through the tunnel:
ssh -p $localPort $remoteUser@localhost
Explanation:
1. Generate SSH Key Pair: The ssh-keygen command generates a new SSH key pair.
2. Create SSH Tunnel: The ssh -L command creates a local port forwarding tunnel.
3. Copy Public Key: The ssh-copy-id command copies your public key to the remote machine, enabling passwordless login.
4. Verify Login: The final ssh command verifies that you can log in without a password.
Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual server and user details. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

configure remote-machine for ssh-key login, no password
Copilot said:
Copilot
To configure the remote machine for SSH key login without a password, you'll need to ensure that the SSH key is properly set up and that the SSH server on the remote machine is configured to accept key-based authentication. Here are the steps:
Step 1: Copy Public Key to Remote Machine
If you haven't already copied your public key to the remote machine, you can do so using the SSH tunnel:
# Define variables
$bastionServer = "bastion.example.com"
$bastionUser = "bastionUser"
$remoteServer = "remote.example.com"
$remoteUser = "remoteUser"
$localPort = 2222
$remotePort = 22
# Create SSH tunnel
ssh -L $localPort:$remoteServer:$remotePort $bastionUser@$bastionServer -N -f
# Copy public key to remote machine
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p $localPort $remoteUser@localhost
Step 2: Configure SSH on Remote Machine
1. Log in to the remote machine through the SSH tunnel:
ssh -p $localPort $remoteUser@localhost
2. Ensure the .ssh directory and authorized_keys file exist:
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
3. Add your public key to the authorized_keys file:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Step 3: Configure SSH Daemon on Remote Machine
1. Edit the SSH daemon configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2. Ensure the following settings are enabled:
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
PasswordAuthentication no
3. Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart sshd
Step 4: Verify Passwordless Login
Finally, verify that you can log in to the remote machine without a password:
ssh -p $localPort $remoteUser@localhost
Explanation:
1. Copy Public Key: The ssh-copy-id command copies your public key to the remote machine.
2. Configure SSH: Ensure the .ssh directory and authorized_keys file are correctly set up and permissions are set.
3. Edit SSH Daemon Configuration: Modify the SSH daemon configuration to enable key-based authentication and disable password authentication.
4. Restart SSH Service: Restart the SSH service to apply the configuration changes.
5. Verify Login: Test the passwordless login to ensure everything is set up correctly.

cifs .smbcreds file
Copilot said:
Copilot
To securely mount a CIFS (Common Internet File System) share using a .smbcreds file, you can follow these steps:
Step 1: Install CIFS Utilities
Ensure that the CIFS utilities are installed on your Linux machine. You can install them using the following commands:
For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
For RHEL/CentOS-based systems:
sudo yum install cifs-utils
Step 2: Create the .smbcreds File
Create a .smbcreds file in your home directory to store your credentials securely:
nano ~/.smbcreds
Add the following content to the file, replacing your_username and your_password with your actual credentials:
username=your_username
password=your_password
Save and close the file, then set the appropriate permissions to ensure that only your user can read it:
chmod 600 ~/.smbcreds
Step 3: Mount the CIFS Share
You can now mount the CIFS share using the .smbcreds file. Replace //server/share with the path to your CIFS share and /mnt/mountpoint with the desired mount point on your local machine:
sudo mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt/mountpoint -o credentials=~/.smbcreds
Step 4: Add to /etc/fstab for Automatic Mounting
To automatically mount the CIFS share at boot, add an entry to your /etc/fstab file:
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add the following line, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:
//server/share /mnt/mountpoint cifs credentials=/home/your_username/.smbcreds 0 0
Explanation:
1. Install CIFS Utilities: Ensures your system can handle CIFS shares.
2. Create .smbcreds File: Stores your credentials securely.
3. Mount CIFS Share: Uses the .smbcreds file to mount the share.
4. Automatic Mounting: Configures the system to mount the share at boot.
This setup helps keep your credentials secure while allowing convenient access to the CIFS share. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

set uid number for /etc/fstab, cifs user
Copilot said:
Copilot
To set a specific UID (User ID) for the CIFS user in your /etc/fstab entry, you can use the uid option. This ensures that the mounted share is owned by the specified user. Here’s how you can do it:
Step 1: Determine the UID
First, find the UID of the user you want to set as the owner of the mounted share. You can find the UID by running:
id -u your_username
Replace your_username with the actual username. This command will output the UID.
Step 2: Edit /etc/fstab
Add or modify the entry in your /etc/fstab file to include the uid option. Here’s an example:
//server/share /mnt/mountpoint cifs credentials=/home/your_username/.smbcreds,uid=1000 0 0
Replace 1000 with the actual UID you obtained in Step 1. Also, replace //server/share, /mnt/mountpoint, and /home/your_username/.smbcreds with your actual values.
Step 3: Mount the Share
After updating /etc/fstab, you can mount the share using:
sudo mount -a
Explanation:
1. Determine UID: Use the id -u command to find the UID of the user.
2. Edit /etc/fstab: Add the uid option to the CIFS entry to set the owner.
3. Mount the Share: Use mount -a to apply the changes and mount the share.
This setup ensures that the mounted CIFS share is owned by the specified user, allowing them to access and manage the files as needed. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

for /etc/fstab, cifs mount, does the uid user have to be the same as the user in the .smbbcreds file
Copilot said:
Copilot
No, the UID specified in the /etc/fstab entry for a CIFS mount does not have to be the same as the user in the .smbcreds file. The .smbcreds file is used to authenticate with the CIFS server, while the uid option in /etc/fstab determines the ownership of the mounted files on your local system.
Example:
1. .smbcreds File:
username=remote_user
password=remote_password
2. /etc/fstab Entry:
//server/share /mnt/mountpoint cifs credentials=/home/local_user/.smbcreds,uid=1000 0 0
In this example:
• remote_user is used to authenticate with the CIFS server.
• local_user with UID 1000 will own the mounted files on the local system.
This setup allows you to use different credentials for accessing the CIFS share and for setting file ownership locally. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance!

cifs mount error 115
Copilot said:
Copilot
The CIFS mount error 115, which states "Operation now in progress," typically indicates a network-related issue. Here are some common causes and solutions:
Common Causes:
1. Network Connectivity: The client cannot communicate with the CIFS server due to network issues.
2. Firewall Settings: The server or an intermediate firewall is blocking the necessary ports.
3. Server Configuration: The CIFS server is not configured to accept connections from the client.
Solutions:
1. Check Network Connectivity:
• Ensure that the client can reach the server. You can use ping or telnet to test connectivity:
ping server_ip
telnet server_ip 445
2. Firewall Settings:
• Ensure that the necessary ports are open on both the server and any intermediate firewalls. The required ports for CIFS are:
• 137/UDP (NetBIOS name service)
• 138/UDP (NetBIOS datagram service)
• 139/TCP (NetBIOS session service)
• 445/TCP (Microsoft-DS)
3. Server Configuration:
• Verify that the CIFS server is configured to accept connections from the client's IP address. This includes checking the server's internal firewall and any security rules for the subnet.
4. Use _netdev Option:
• Adding the _netdev option in your /etc/fstab entry can help delay the mount until after the network is up:
//server/share /mnt/mountpoint cifs credentials=/home/your_username/.smbcreds,uid=1000,_netdev 0 0
Example /etc/fstab Entry:
//server/share /mnt/mountpoint cifs credentials=/home/your_username/.smbcreds,uid=1000,_netdev 0 0
Additional Troubleshooting:
• Check the system logs for more detailed error messages:
dmesg | grep CIFS
These steps should help you diagnose and resolve the CIFS mount error 115

cifs mount, version arugment
Copilot said:
Copilot
To specify the version of the SMB protocol when mounting a CIFS share, you can use the vers option in your mount command or /etc/fstab entry. This is useful if you need to ensure compatibility with different versions of the SMB protocol.
Example Mount Command:
sudo mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt/mountpoint -o credentials=/home/your_username/.smbcreds,vers=3.0
Example /etc/fstab Entry:
//server/share /mnt/mountpoint cifs credentials=/home/your_username/.smbcreds,uid=1000,vers=3.0 0 0
Supported Versions:
• vers=1.0: SMB 1.0 (CIFS)
• vers=2.0: SMB 2.0
• vers=2.1: SMB 2.1
• vers=3.0: SMB 3.0
• vers=3.1.1: SMB 3.1.1
Explanation:
• vers=3.0: Specifies that the SMB 3.0 protocol should be used. You can adjust this to the version supported by your server.
Using the vers option ensures that the client and server communicate using the specified version of the SMB protocol, which can help avoid compatibility issues

check is port is open on local linux
Copilot said:
Copilot
To check if a specific port is open on your local Linux machine, you can use several tools. Here are a few methods:
Method 1: Using netstat
The netstat command can display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
sudo netstat -tuln | grep :<port_number>
Replace <port_number> with the port you want to check. For example, to check if port 80 is open:
sudo netstat -tuln | grep :80
Method 2: Using ss
The ss command is used to dump socket statistics. It can display more information than netstat and is often faster.
sudo ss -tuln | grep :<port_number>
Replace <port_number> with the port you want to check. For example, to check if port 80 is open:
sudo ss -tuln | grep :80
Method 3: Using lsof
The lsof command lists open files and can be used to check open ports.
sudo lsof -i :<port_number>
Replace <port_number> with the port you want to check. For example, to check if port 80 is open:
sudo lsof -i :80
Method 4: Using nmap
The nmap command is a network scanning tool that can be used to check open ports.
sudo nmap -p <port_number> localhost
Replace <port_number> with the port you want to check. For example, to check if port 80 is open:
sudo nmap -p 80 localhost
Explanation:
1. netstat: Lists network connections and listening ports.
2. ss: Displays socket statistics and listening ports.
3. lsof: Lists open files and network connections.
4. nmap: Scans for open ports on the local machine.
These methods should help you determine if a specific port is open on your local Linux machine. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
