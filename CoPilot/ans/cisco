Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a detailed walkthrough on how to configure Ansible on Rocky Linux for managing Cisco network devices:

1. Install Ansible on Rocky Linux
First, ensure your system is up-to-date and install Ansible:

sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install epel-release -y
sudo dnf install ansible -y
Verify the installation:

ansible --version
2. Set Up Ansible Inventory
Create an inventory file to list your Cisco devices. This file is typically located at /etc/ansible/hosts:

sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
Add your Cisco devices to the inventory file:

[cisco]
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2
3. Configure Ansible for Cisco Devices
Ansible uses SSH to communicate with devices. Ensure SSH is enabled on your Cisco devices and that you have the necessary credentials.

4. Create Ansible Playbooks
Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define tasks to be executed on your devices. Here's an example playbook to gather facts from Cisco devices:

---
- name: Gather facts from Cisco devices
  hosts: cisco
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Gather facts
      cisco.ios.ios_facts:
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: "your_username"
          password: "your_password"
          authorize: yes
          auth_pass: "your_enable_password"
Save this playbook as gather_facts.yml.

5. Run the Playbook
Execute the playbook to gather facts from your Cisco devices:

ansible-playbook gather_facts.yml
6. Advanced Configuration
For more advanced configurations, you can create playbooks to manage VLANs, interfaces, and other network settings. Here's an example to configure a VLAN:

---
- name: Configure VLAN on Cisco devices
  hosts: cisco
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Configure VLAN
      cisco.ios.ios_vlan:
        vlan_id: 10
        name: "Management"
        state: present
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: "your_username"
          password: "your_password"
          authorize: yes
          auth_pass: "your_enable_password"
Save this playbook as configure_vlan.yml and run it with:

ansible-playbook configure_vlan.yml
