Sure, I can help you with that! Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to configure Ansible on Rocky Linux:

Step 1: Update System Packages
First, ensure your system packages are up to date:

sudo yum update
Step 2: Install Python and Pip
Ansible requires Python. Check if Python is installed and install it if necessary:

sudo yum install python3 python3-pip
Step 3: Install Ansible
You can install Ansible using pip:

pip3 install ansible
Step 4: Verify Ansible Installation
Check if Ansible is installed correctly:

ansible --version
Step 5: Configure Ansible
Create an inventory file to define the hosts you want to manage. For example, create a file named hosts:

[webservers]
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2

[dbservers]
192.168.1.3
Step 6: Create a User Profile for Ansible
Create a user profile with sudo privileges for Ansible to use:

Add a new user:
sudo useradd ansibleuser
Set a password for the new user:
sudo passwd ansibleuser
Add the user to the sudoers file:
sudo usermod -aG wheel ansibleuser
Step 7: Set Up SSH Keys
Generate an SSH key pair for the Ansible user and copy the public key to the managed hosts:

Generate SSH keys:
sudo -u ansibleuser ssh-keygen
Copy the public key to the managed hosts:
ssh-copy-id ansibleuser@192.168.1.1
ssh-copy-id ansibleuser@192.168.1.2
ssh-copy-id ansibleuser@192.168.1.3
Step 8: Test Ansible Configuration
Run a simple command to test the configuration:

ansible all -m ping -i hosts -u ansibleuser
This should return a "pong" response from each host, indicating that Ansible is correctly configured.

If you need more detailed instructions, you can refer to the DigitalOcean guide or the Rocky Linux documentation12.
