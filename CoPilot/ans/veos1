Sure! Ansible can be used to automate the management of Arista EOS devices. Here are some useful resources and examples to get you started:

Arista EOS Configuration with Ansible:

The arista.eos.eos_config module allows you to manage Arista EOS configuration sections. This module can handle configurations using either CLI or eAPI transports. You can find detailed documentation and examples here1.
Example Playbooks:

The arista-netdevops-community repository on GitHub contains various Ansible playbooks for interacting with Arista EOS. These playbooks cover tasks such as enabling eAPI, managing VLANs, configuring login banners, and collecting device data2.
Arista AVD (Architect, Validate, Deploy):

Arista Networks provides a collection of Ansible roles and modules to help automate the management of devices running Arista's EOS. This includes support for both eAPI and CloudVision Portal (CVP). You can explore this collection on GitHub3.

Playbook File (playbook.yml)
---
- name: Configure Arista EOS
  hosts: arista
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Enable eAPI
      arista.eos.eos_config:
        lines:
          - management api http-commands
          - no shutdown
        provider:
          host: "{{ ansible_host }}"
          username: "{{ ansible_user }}"
          password: "{{ ansible_password }}"

    - name: Configure VLAN
      arista.eos.eos_config:
        lines:
          - vlan 10
          - name Test_VLAN

          host: "{{ ansible_host }}"
