Creating an advanced inventory file for network devices in Ansible can greatly enhance your automation capabilities. Here's a basic guide to get you started:

Basic Structure
An inventory file can be written in YAML or INI format. Here's an example in YAML:

all:
  children:
    network:
      children:
        leafs:
          hosts:
            leaf01:
              ansible_host: 10.16.10.11
              ansible_network_os: vyos.vyos.vyos
              ansible_user: my_vyos_user
            leaf02:
              ansible_host: 10.16.10.12
              ansible_network_os: vyos.vyos.vyos
              ansible_user: my_vyos_user
        spines:
          hosts:
            spine01:
              ansible_host: 10.16.10.13
              ansible_network_os: vyos.vyos.vyos
              ansible_user: my_vyos_user
            spine02:
              ansible_host: 10.16.10.14
              ansible_network_os: vyos.vyos.vyos
              ansible_user: my_vyos_user
        webservers:
          hosts:
            webserver01:
              ansible_host: 10.16.10.15
              ansible_user: my_server_user
            webserver02:
              ansible_host: 10.16.10.16
              ansible_user: my_server_user
      vars:
        ansible_connection: network_cli
        ansible_network_os: ios
        ansible_user: admin
        ansible_password: password
Key Points
Grouping: Devices are grouped logically (e.g., leafs, spines, webservers).
Variables: Variables like ansible_host, ansible_network_os, and ansible_user are defined for each host.
Connection Settings: Global variables for connection settings are set under vars.
Advanced Features
Dynamic Inventory: Use plugins to dynamically generate inventory from cloud providers or other sources.
Group Variables: Define variables at the group level to apply them to all hosts within the group.
For more detailed information, you can refer to the Ansible documentation on building inventories12.

block comments in yaml file

YAML does not support block (multi-line) comments natively. However, you can achieve a similar effect by prefixing each line of your comment with the # character. Here's an example:

# This is a block comment in YAML
# Each line must be prefixed with a #
# This way, you can write multi-line comments
# to explain your configuration.
This approach allows you to document your YAML files effectively, even though it requires a bit more effort compared to languages that support true block comments12.

ini file block comments

INI files do not support block comments natively. However, you can write multi-line comments by prefixing each line with a semicolon (;) or a hash (#). Here's an example:

; This is a multi-line comment
; Each line must start with a semicolon
; This way, you can document your INI file

# Alternatively, you can use a hash
# for each line of your comment
# to achieve the same effect
This method allows you to add detailed comments to your INI files, even though it requires a bit more effort compared to languages that support true block comments12.
