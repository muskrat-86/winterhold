To deploy a VM in vCenter using Salt, you'll need to configure Salt Cloud with the VMware provider. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:
1. Install Required Packages
Ensure you have Salt and pyVmomi installed on your Salt master:
pip install pyvmomi
2. Configure the VMware Cloud Provider
Create a configuration file for the VMware cloud provider. This file should include your vCenter credentials and connection details.
/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/vmware.conf:
my-vmware-config:
  driver: vmware
  user: 'DOMAIN\\user'
  password: 'your_password'
  url: 'https://vcenter.domain.com'
  protocol: 'https'
  port: 443
3. Define Cloud Profiles
Set up profiles for the VMs you want to manage. These profiles define the VM specifications such as CPU, memory, disk, and network settings.
/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/vmware.conf:
vmware-centos7:
  provider: my-vmware-config
  clonefrom: base-template
  num_cpus: 4
  memory: 8GB
  devices:
    disk:
      Hard disk 1:
        size: 40
  network:
    Network adapter 1:
      name: VM Network
      switch_type: standard
  deploy: True
  power_on: True
4. Create and Manage VMs
Use Salt Cloud commands to create and manage VMs based on the defined profiles.
salt-cloud -p vmware-centos7 new-vm-name
5. Automate Tasks with Salt States
Write Salt states to automate tasks such as software installation, configuration management, and system updates.
/srv/salt/apache/init.sls:
apache:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: httpd
  service.running:
    - name: httpd
    - enable: True
6. Apply States to VMs
Apply the Salt states to your VMs to automate the desired tasks.
salt 'new-vm-name' state.apply apache
