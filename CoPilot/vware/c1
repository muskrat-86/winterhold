Setting up vSphere Integrated Containers (VIC) with vCenter involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview to get you started:

Download the OVA Installer: Obtain the official build of the vSphere Integrated Containers appliance from the VMware website.

Deploy the Appliance:

In the vSphere Web Client, right-click an object in the vCenter Server inventory.
Select Deploy OVF Template and navigate to the OVA file.
Follow the installer prompts to configure the appliance, including setting the root password and network settings1.
Configure the Appliance:

Set up the vSphere Integrated Containers Registry and Management Portal.
Optionally, configure custom certificates for secure connections1.
Access the Management Portal: Once deployed, you can access the Management Portal to manage your containers and virtual container hosts (VCHs).

For detailed instructions, you can refer to the official documentation1.

If you have any specific questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!

vcenter, create additional vms if load is breached
Copilot said:
Copilot
To automatically create additional VMs in vCenter when the load is breached, you can use VMware's vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) and vRealize Automation. Here's a high-level overview of how you can set this up:

Enable DRS:

Ensure that DRS is enabled on your vSphere cluster. DRS will help balance the load across your cluster by migrating VMs as needed.
Set Up vRealize Automation:

Install and configure vRealize Automation (vRA). This tool allows you to automate the provisioning of VMs based on predefined policies.
Create Blueprints in vRA:

Define blueprints in vRA for the VMs you want to deploy. These blueprints will specify the configuration and resources for the VMs.
Configure Policies:

Set up policies in vRA to monitor the load on your existing VMs. You can use metrics like CPU and memory usage to trigger the creation of new VMs.
Integrate with vCenter:

Ensure that vRA is integrated with your vCenter environment. This integration allows vRA to deploy new VMs directly into your vSphere cluster.
Test the Setup:

Simulate high load conditions to test if new VMs are automatically created and added to the cluster as expected.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the VMware documentation1.

powercli, automate vm creation if load is too high
Copilot said:
Copilot
To automate VM creation using PowerCLI when the load is too high, you can create a script that monitors the load on your existing VMs and deploys new VMs as needed. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:

Install PowerCLI:

Ensure you have PowerCLI installed. You can install it using the following command in PowerShell:
Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI -Scope CurrentUser
Connect to vCenter:

Use the Connect-VIServer cmdlet to connect to your vCenter server:
Connect-VIServer -Server your_vcenter_server -User your_username -Password your_password
Monitor VM Load:

Create a function to monitor the CPU and memory usage of your VMs. You can use the Get-Stat cmdlet to retrieve performance metrics:
function Get-VMUsage {
    param (
        [string]$vmName
    )
    $cpuUsage = Get-Stat -Entity (Get-VM -Name $vmName) -Stat cpu.usage.average -Realtime -MaxSamples 1
    $memUsage = Get-Stat -Entity (Get-VM -Name $vmName) -Stat mem.usage.average -Realtime -MaxSamples 1
    return [PSCustomObject]@{
        VMName  = $vmName
        CPUUsage = $cpuUsage.Value
        MemUsage = $memUsage.Value
    }
}
Deploy New VMs:

Create a function to deploy new VMs from a template when the load exceeds a certain threshold:
function Deploy-NewVM {
    param (
        [string]$templateName,
        [string]$vmName,
        [string]$datastore,
        [string]$vmHost
    )
    New-VM -Name $vmName -Template $templateName -Datastore $datastore -VMHost $vmHost
}
Automate the Process:

Combine the monitoring and deployment functions in a script that runs periodically to check the load and deploy new VMs if necessary:
$threshold = 80  # Set your CPU or memory usage threshold
$templateName = "YourTemplate"
$datastore = "YourDatastore"
$vmHost = "YourVMHost"

while ($true) {
    $vms = Get-VM
    foreach ($vm in $vms) {
        $usage = Get-VMUsage -vmName $vm.Name
        if ($usage.CPUUsage -gt $threshold -or $usage.MemUsage -gt $threshold) {
            $newVMName = "NewVM_" + (Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss")
            Deploy-NewVM -templateName $templateName -vmName $newVMName -datastore $datastore -vmHost $vmHost
            Write-Host "Deployed new VM: $newVMName"
        }
    }
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 300  # Check every 5 minutes
}
This script will continuously monitor the load on your VMs and deploy new ones if the load exceeds the specified threshold12.

Feel free to adjust the script to better fit your environment and specific requirements. If you have any questions or need further customization, let me know!
