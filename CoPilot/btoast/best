powershell, add computer to ad group
Copilot said:

To add a computer to an Active Directory (AD) group using PowerShell, you can use the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

Single Computer:

Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "GroupName" -Members "ComputerName$"
Replace "GroupName" with the name of your AD group and "ComputerName$" with the SAM account name of the computer (note the $ at the end).

Multiple Computers from a CSV File: If you have a list of computers in a CSV file, you can add them all to a group with a script like this:

$SecurityGroupName = "GroupName"
$ComputerList = Import-Csv "C:\Path\To\ComputerList.csv"

foreach ($Computer in $ComputerList) {
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $SecurityGroupName -Members "$($Computer.Name)$"
}
Ensure your CSV file has a column named Name with the computer names.

These scripts will help you efficiently manage AD group memberships12. If you need further customization or have specific requirements, feel free to ask!

To add an SSH banner on Rocky Linux, follow these steps:

Create the Banner File: First, create a file that will contain your custom banner message. For example, you can create a file named /etc/ssh/ssh_banner:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_banner
Add your custom message to this file. For example:

**************************************************
* Unauthorized access is prohibited.             *
* All activities are monitored and recorded.     *
* Disconnect immediately if you are not authorized.*
**************************************************
Configure SSH to Use the Banner: Next, edit the SSH configuration file to specify the path to your banner file:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Find the line that starts with #Banner and uncomment it by removing the # symbol. Then, set it to the path of your banner file:

Banner /etc/ssh/ssh_banner
Restart the SSH Service: To apply the changes, restart the SSH service:

sudo systemctl restart sshd
Verify the Banner: Finally, test your SSH connection to ensure the banner is displayed before the login prompt:

ssh user@your_server_ip
This will display your custom SSH banner message before the user logs in12. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
